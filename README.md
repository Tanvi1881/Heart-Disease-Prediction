# Heart-Disease-Prediction
Heart failure is a serious problem which has a huge impact on peopleâ€™s life. With the accelerated pace of life, increased portion sizes and inactivity, most people always ignore their health. Moreover, because of the environmental deterioration, those factors can lead to the issue of heart failure which can become more and more common in the future. If people did not pay attention to the issue of heart failure, it would finally cause the death. In the past years, different researchers used different methods to collect and analyze data with the aim to predict heart failure. These data include electronic health record (EHR) data of patients with heart failure in different hospitals from different countries, Cleveland heart disease dataset, biomedical science datasets from UCI, etc. cardiovascular diseases remain a significant global health concern, necessitating efficient and accurate predictive tools for timely intervention. Machine learning methodologies have emerged as promising approaches for heart disease prediction, leveraging patient information to provide proactive insights. This study focuses on the creation and assessment of a heart disease prediction system employing diverse machine learning algorithms.
